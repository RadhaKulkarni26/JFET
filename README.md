### The Field Effect Transistor (FET) is a semiconductor device that uses an electric field to control the flow of current in the semiconductor. It has 3 terminals: source, gate, and drain. Here, the current flows between drain and source terminal and it can be controlled by applying a voltage between gate and source.
